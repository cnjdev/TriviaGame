### TriviaGame

Play the game here: https://cnjdev.github.io/TriviaGame/

This is a trivia game with a theme inspired by the movie Monty Python and the Holy Grail.  Before the game starts, the theme of the movie plays in the background.

There are 8 questions taken from different scenes of the movie, though primarily from the Bridge of Death scene.  When introducing a question, sometimes a sound relating to the question is played.  After a question is answered or time has run out, a sound plays and a GIF image is shown. (In some cases, the sound can differ depending if the question was answered correctly.)

At the end of the game, the user is shown their score of Correct answers, Incorrect answers, and Timed-out questions along with the movie clip of the protagonists at the Bridge of Death.
